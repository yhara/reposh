== Reposh - what's this?

Without reposh, you type like this:
  $ svk di
  $ svk ci
  $ svk st
  $ ls
but this is not DRY :)

With reposh, you can omit typing all 'svk's:
  $ reposh
  Welcome to reposh x.y.z (mode: svk)
  > di
  > ci
  >          # just push [Enter] for 'svk status'
  > :ls      # start with ':' to run shell commands

== How to use

(1) write /home/(your name)/.reposh.yaml
(2) cd to your working directory
(3) reposh.rb [Enter]

== Options

see reposh.rb --help

== Commands

* exit, quit, ^D(^Z)
  * Quit reposh
* :ls ~/
  * Run "ls ~/" by shell
* [Enter]
  * Equals to "status" (you can change this by .reposh.yaml) 
* %reload
  * Reload reposh.rb (for reposh developper)
  * Some more commands starts with % are supported: see source

All other commands are passed to vcs system.
